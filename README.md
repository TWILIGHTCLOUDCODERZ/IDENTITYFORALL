# IDENTITYFORALL + PowerToFly Student Hackathon (August 2022)

## Inspiration

Microsoft Azure AD  Inspired to access apps/software using each one identity anything social/enterprise or business account in a secured way also highly scalable. Which protect user account from phishing, brute force, hijack, MIM attacks, sql Injection (apps), other malware threats.
SSO with MFA plays major protection for apps.
For on premises ADFS configuration protects organization from outside threat.

## What it does
Raptor web app helps customer and business group to access app in a secured way using SSO and MFA authentication.

<li>Social identity application access- #B2C</li>
<li>business organization account app access-#B2B </li>
